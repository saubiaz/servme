Looking at the above defined classes we can notice that there are a lot in common between them, is such a redundancy a bad or good
practice? why?

This redundancy is not good practice because if there is a change required in the searchByName class
(since the implementations of both the classes are same) then we need to make changes in both the methods otherwise it may
create an ambiguity in the  code.
