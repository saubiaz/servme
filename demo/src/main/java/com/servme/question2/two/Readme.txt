1. Did statement on line 4 fix the name inserted item at line 2 or we have now a duplicate item?
We have both the items added in the list with the same id

2.If we have duplicate item then how can we fix this problem?
We can fix the problem by overriding the equals() and hashcode() in the class of Item

3.We need to have any two items with same id be treated as same one
